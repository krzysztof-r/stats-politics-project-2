# Stats and Politics 2: Data Analysis
You've worked hard to clean and organize your data, and you were excited to draw insights from it. HOWEVER, when you return to check on the data you were storing online, you discover 70% of the demographic data has been wiped clean! You were able to deliver exact insights before, but now, you only have 30% of the data so you will have to turn to statistics to derive confidence in your analysis.

Your instructors will provide you with a new dataset for this analysis. The dataset will be composed of three files which you will have to join on the FIPS code using pandas

Which data columns are strongly or moderately correlated with the Republican vote share? Which columns are not? Does this pattern appear in both elections? Are these correlations statistically significant?

(Hint: You will need to research what qualifies as "strongly or moderately correlated" and provide the references that guided your decisions)

You are given the results of a poll of voting preferences for the 2016 US Election.
The sample size for the poll was 2,133. The sample was taken from eligible voters in the states of Florida and Pennsylvania.

Out of 1,042 respondents in Florida, approximately 46.84% would vote for the Democrats, and 45.22% for the Republicans
Out of 1,091 respondents in Pennsylvania, approximately 48.94% would be voting for the Democrats, and 41.2% for the Republicans
Run a hypothesis test to see whether voters' location is independent of their voting preference. Make sure to state your hypotheses and discuss your test result.

Fit and optimize linear regression and logistic regression models that predict 2016 relative vote share of the Republican party within a county using the county-level demographic data. For each model, answer the following questions:

What are the independent and dependent variables in this case? Which dependent variables are most positively and negatively predictive?
How good is the fit of your model? What metric is a good measure to evaluate your model? Discuss your results.
